# Skelocator Project
Run by Team Skelocator, CTC14

## Background
This project was part of [Code The City 14 - Archaeology](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/ctc14) hack weekend, run in Aberdeen on 15th - 16th September 2018.

## Purpose
To identfy and extract data from miscellaneous sources arising from the excavation of the Mither Kirk in 2006.

This addressed two specific challenges 
- converting data from a [Microsoft Access2 Database](Levels.mdb)
- identifying co-ordinate information for skeletons and other remains from scanned plans

The former was a 2006 database of transcribed data from the levels notebooks created at the dig and which recorded the various levels of the excavation. 

## Progress
The [Levels database](Levels.mdb) was processed and two CSV files produced: [Tables Export](Levels_Table_export.csv) and [Queries Export](Levels_query_export.csv)

The scanned plans were in a mixture of TIFs and JPGs. 

We identified that the [Sloth Application](https://github.com/cvhciKIT/sloth) would allow us to manually capture co-ordinates from plans and export these as a json file per scan of a level.
